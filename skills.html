            <h1>My <span>Skills</span></h1>

            <h2>👨‍💻 Programming & Development</h2>
            <p>I have experience with Python for scripting and small projects, and I’m currently studying HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and Java. I use these languages to build basic websites, CRUD systems, and backend logic using MySQL as the database.</p>

            <h2>🌐 Web & Database Technologies</h2>
            <p>I work with XAMPP to simulate server environments and use MySQL for creating and managing relational databases. I understand how to connect frontend and backend, and I’m improving my skills in full-stack development.</p>

            <h2>🔒 IoT & Automation Projects</h2>
            <p>I'm working on a real-world project involving the ESP32 and a webcam (Logitech C920), using OpenCV and Flask to capture images when motion is detected, and automatically sending data to a Discord channel. This project also includes logging, system configuration, and RESTful APIs.</p>

            <h2>🛠️ Version Control & Tools</h2>
            <p>I use Git and GitHub to manage my code and track changes, and Visual Studio Code as my main editor.</p>

            <h2>🤝 Soft Skills & Work Background</h2>
            <p>Before entering tech, I gained experience working with consortia, insurance, and sales. This gave me strong communication skills, customer service experience, and the ability to understand client needs and propose effective solutions.</p>

            <h2>🚀 Currently Improving</h2>
            <p>I'm focused on improving my web development skills, learning JavaScript deeply, and building real-world applications that solve practical problems. I also enjoy exploring automation and artificial intelligence tools.</p>
