            <h1>My <span>Skills</span></h1>
            <p>Programming & Development
I have experience with Python for scripting and small projects, and I’m currently studying HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and Java. I use these languages to build basic websites, CRUD systems, and backend logic using MySQL as the database.

Web & Database Technologies
I work with XAMPP to simulate server environments and use MySQL for creating and managing relational databases. I understand how to connect frontend and backend, and I’m improving my skills in full-stack development.

IoT & Automation Projects
I'm working on a real-world project involving the ESP32 and a webcam (Logitech C920), using OpenCV and Flask to capture images when motion is detected, and automatically sending data to a Discord channel. This project also includes logging, system configuration, and RESTful APIs.

Version Control & Tools
I use Git and GitHub to manage my code and track changes, and Visual Studio Code as my main editor.

Soft Skills & Work Background
Before entering tech, I gained experience working with consortia, insurance, and sales. This gave me strong communication skills, customer service experience, and the ability to understand client needs and propose effective solutions.

Currently Improving
I'm focused on improving my web development skills, learning JavaScript deeply, and building real-world applications that solve practical problems. I also enjoy exploring automation and artificial intelligence tools.</p>
