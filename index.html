            <h1>Hi, It's <span>Éden</span></h1>
            <h3 class="typing-text">I'm a <span></span></h3>
            <p>I'm an 18-year-old Software Engineering student at PUCPR, passionate about creating smart and useful digital solutions. With a strong foundation in Python, PHP, and MySQL, I'm currently expanding my skills in Web Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), Java, and Databases.

Beyond academics, I have real-world experience in customer service, insurance consulting, and consortia sales — which taught me how to listen, communicate, and deliver results. This blend of tech and business has shaped my approach: practical, curious, and always focused on solving real problems.

I’m fluent in English, actively learning new technologies, and currently working on projects involving computer vision, IoT (ESP32), AI integration, and full-stack systems.

In my free time, I enjoy playing soccer, watching movies, reading manga and comics, and gaming.

I believe in continuous growth, collaboration, and using technology to make life easier — and I’m just getting started.</p>
